# A Basic React Interface to add, delete, and search items with the option to order & sort;

This is one of my first react projects and  was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Future improvements:
 
In addition to changes in style and form options, an important example of possible future improvments is developing this basic frontend interface into a fullstack react site. Fetching data from an API, saving data into a database are but few examples of what the fullstack react site could make use of.
